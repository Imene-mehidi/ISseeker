ISseeker requires these PERL modules to run (all available from CPAN):


Bio::SeqIO
Config::General
Cwd
File::Basename
Getopt::Long
List::Util
Log::Log4perl
Text::CSV
Class::Accessor


If you do not wish to (or cannot) install these in your PERL system libraries, you can install them in this perllib/ directory and they will be used from here.
